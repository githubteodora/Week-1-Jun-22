# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
---
## Overview of the Project
- This project aims to reveal how different kickstarter campaigns fared in relation to their launch dates and their funding goals. The focus is on the "plays" subcategory.
- The analysis is based on a dataset that contains data about more than 4k kickstarter projects globally, spanning 9 genres and 41 subcategories. The "plays" subcategory alone includes more than 1k projects. The projects took place between 2009 and 2017.

## Analysis and Challenges: 

Headers are signified with a #. The number of hashtags indicates the level of the header. For example, ### is a third-level header.
Bullets are added in three ways: a typical bullet with an asterisk, a numbered bullet with numbers, or a hyphenated bullet with a hyphen.
Images can be added with the following syntax: ![image_name](path/to/image_name.png).
Hyperlinks to relevant files are  added in a similar manner: [filename](path/to/filename.xlxs).
Line breaks are added by using three consecutive hyphens: ---.
